THE CÁLƐNÐR
-

absolutely the best calendar software ever

- completely customizable with ease
- just modify the config object in the js file for most things (days in a week must be seven, i have that hardcoded in; you can always change that... if you want for some reason)

example:

<img width="1493" height="906" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec1c4a28-8b80-421d-9a10-a3a5f0df0616" />
